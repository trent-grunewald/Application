                        I have years of experience working with people who have a wide range of personalities. This includes leading Disney Usability tests with hundreds of people, Community Management for Zipper Interactive / SCEA and my years as a team and project manager.<br><Br>

                        I simply enjoy working with and helping others, and my years of experiences have helped me learn how to approach each individual differently.

                          Not only that, but they are able to cancel, update, return and subscribe to certain orders without any hassle. I feel like they do everything they can to make it as easy as possible for the customer, especially when it comes to doing the one thing everyone hates doing, returning something.</p>
